% \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\numberline{}Abstract}
The need for reliable infant monitoring systems has grown due to the high demands of modern parenting and the importance of ensuring infant safety. This project presents a ``Cloud-Based Smart Monitoring System for Baby Health and Safety," which monitors key health metrics such as body temperature, heart rate, room temperature, humidity, and posture. By providing real-time notifications and alerts, the system offers parents peace of mind and enhances infant safety.
  
Recent advancements in non-contact health monitoring utilize technologies like remote photoplethysmography and computer vision for detecting health parameters. However, existing systems often lack comprehensive capabilities or rely on contact-based sensors that may cause discomfort to infants. This project overcomes these challenges by integrating contactless sensors and machine learning techniques, creating a holistic and user-friendly monitoring solution.

The methodology involves developing a mobile application that interacts with a cloud-based system and sensors to analyze infant health data in real time. The system employs computer vision algorithms to monitor baby posture and detect unsafe positions, such as tummy sleeping, potentially preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Experimental results confirm the system's reliability and accuracy under various environmental conditions, providing immediate alerts during abnormalities.

This work significantly enhances infant safety by reducing the need for constant parental monitoring while offering peace of mind. The cloud-based architecture supports remote monitoring, ensuring efficient resource utilization. The system demonstrates a valuable contribution to infant health care by combining advanced technology with practical usability.

\section{Background}
The health and safety of infants are critical concerns for parents, particularly when they are unable to provide constant supervision due to other responsibilities. One of the major risks to infants during sleep is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which can occur if the baby unknowingly assumes an unsafe sleeping posture. In addition to posture, environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and the baby’s health indicators—such as body temperature and heart rate—can have significant impacts on the baby’s well-being. The lack of real-time, comprehensive monitoring systems makes it difficult for parents to detect these risks in time. This project, Cloud-Based Smart Monitoring System for Baby Health and Safety, is designed to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced software algorithms and cloud-based solutions to provide real-time monitoring of a baby’s health and surroundings. With the integration of multiple sensors and a camera, the system ensures that any abnormalities, such as unsafe sleeping postures or sudden health changes, are detected and immediately communicated to the parents through a mobile application, helping to prevent potential health risks.

With the advancement of technology, there has been a growing interest in creating smart monitoring systems that go beyond simple video surveillance, incorporating health data analytics. This project aims to build on existing systems by introducing an innovative, software-focused approach that can simultaneously monitor and process multiple parameters, such as the baby’s posture, heart rate, and environmental conditions. Using cloud computing for real-time data processing and alerts, the system will allow parents to track their child’s well-being from any location, ensuring both the baby’s safety and the parents’ peace of mind. The focus on cloud infrastructure also allows scalability, enabling the system to be expanded with additional features and updates as needed.

\section{Problem statement }
To develop a cloud-based smart monitoring system that addresses the challenges parents face in continuously monitoring their infants, particularly when away from home. The system will use real-time data from sensors and video feeds to detect unsafe sleeping postures, abnormal body temperature, irregular heart rate, and environmental factors such as humidity. By using software-driven algorithms for analysis and alerting, the system will notify parents instantly of any concerns, thus preventing risks like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and ensuring the infant's health and safety.
\section{Objectives}
The objectives of the proposed project work are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a mobile app that collects the body temperature of the baby and room temperature from the cloud, which is transmitted from the monitoring device.
    \item To integrate computer vision technology to detect unsafe sleeping positions of the baby.
    \item To create a user-friendly interface that allows parents to easily monitor real-time temperature readings regardless of the distance.
    \item To deliver actionable notifications through app alerts when abnormal readings or unsafe sleeping position is detected.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Scope}
The Cloud-Based Smart Monitoring System for Baby Health and Safety aims to provide a comprehensive, software-driven solution for real-time monitoring of a baby’s health, environment, and movements. The project’s scope includes the development of advanced algorithms to detect unsafe sleeping postures using computer vision, as well as the integration of sensor data from temperature, humidity, and heart rate monitors. The software will process this data in real-time through a cloud infrastructure, delivering instant alerts to parents via a mobile application whenever abnormalities are detected, such as a sudden change in the baby’s sleeping position, body temperature, or crying. This monitoring will be continuous and remote, ensuring that parents receive timely notifications even when they are away from home.

The project is highly relevant in today's fast-paced world, where parents are often unable to supervise their children around the clock. The system can be applied in homes, daycares, or hospitals, giving caregivers real-time insight into the baby’s well-being. By focusing on software for analyzing health and environmental data, this project addresses a significant gap in traditional baby monitors, which are often limited in functionality. The use of cloud technology ensures scalability, allowing for future enhancements such as the addition of more sensors or features, thereby making the system adaptable to evolving needs in infant care and monitoring, as well as regardless of the distance between the parent and the child, the vitals of the child can be monitored by the parents from any location.

\section{Proposed system}

The Cloud-Based Smart Monitoring System for Baby Health and Safety is designed to ensure the well-being of infants through real-time monitoring of critical health parameters and environmental conditions. It integrates various IoT sensors to measure the baby's body temperature, room temperature, humidity, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). A camera captures live video feeds, enabling the detection of unsafe sleeping positions using advanced computer vision algorithms. The system is powered by a Raspberry Pi, which collects and processes data, transmitting it to a cloud infrastructure for storage and analysis. A mobile application serves as the user interface, providing parents with real-time access to health data and alerts.

The system offers numerous benefits, including enhanced safety through continuous monitoring and immediate alerts for potential health issues, which can be crucial for preventing incidents such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Its intuitive mobile application ensures easy access to vital information, allowing parents to monitor their baby’s health from anywhere. Additionally, the cloud-based architecture facilitates scalability for future enhancements. Overall, this proposed system significantly advances the intersection of technology and infant care, promoting a safer and more responsive environment for parents and their babies.

\subsection{Importance of chosen project}
The chosen project addresses a critical need for continuous monitoring of infants, a task that is particularly challenging for parents, especially when they are away from home. Infants are vulnerable to health risks that can arise unexpectedly, making it essential for caregivers to have reliable systems in place to monitor their well-being. By integrating various health sensors, video feeds, and cloud-based real-time analysis, the system ensures that parents are immediately alerted to potential health risks. This proactive approach to monitoring can help prevent life-threatening conditions such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and other critical health issues, ultimately providing parents with much-needed peace of mind. The project's significance is underscored by the growing demand for technology that can support busy families in maintaining the safety and health of their infants.
\subsection{Novelty in Proposed project}
The novelty of the proposed project lies in its comprehensive integration of multiple health parameters—such as body temperature, heart rate, SpO2, humidity, and more—with video-based posture detection. This data is processed in real-time using advanced cloud technology. Unlike most existing systems, which tend to focus on isolated health metrics or lack the functionality for real-time monitoring, this system offers a unified platform that simultaneously tracks various aspects of a baby’s health. The use of machine learning algorithms for video analysis further distinguishes this project, as it allows for automatic detection of unsafe sleeping positions. This combination of features provides a more holistic approach to infant monitoring that is not commonly found in current market solutions.
\subsection{Advancement of State-of-the-Art}
The project advances the state-of-the-art by merging health monitoring with video-based posture analysis through the application of artificial intelligence techniques. Current solutions typically operate in silos, either relying solely on health sensors or focusing on video surveillance without integrating the two. This system’s multi-faceted approach ensures comprehensive monitoring, as it not only tracks vital health parameters but also observes the baby’s physical position. Additionally, leveraging cloud technology allows for scalable and remote access to the monitoring data, making the system more robust and future-proof. By employing cutting-edge technologies, this project aims to set new standards in the realm of infant health monitoring.

\subsection{Differentiation from Existing Works}
This project differentiates itself from existing works that focus solely on either wearable sensors or video-based monitoring by integrating both components into a single, cohesive system. This comprehensive approach makes it more effective in providing thorough monitoring of infants. The incorporation of deep learning techniques for posture detection, combined with real-time alerts, sets this system apart from those that rely merely on sensor-based monitoring. Furthermore, the use of a cloud infrastructure ensures seamless access to data from remote locations, allowing busy parents to stay informed about their baby’s health at all times. This combination of features not only enhances the practicality of the system but also addresses the evolving needs of modern families.

This Figure \ref{fig:pic1} illustrates a high-level overview of the audio visual speech separation system. It is important to note that the specific techniques, algorithms, and models used in each component can vary depending on the implementation approach and the requirements of the system.
\section{Decomposition Description}

\end{figure}
\newpage
Figure \ref{fig:pic2} represent the flow chart of the proposed system. In audio visual speech separation, the goal is to decompose an audio signal containing multiple overlapping speakers into individual speech signals corresponding to each speaker. The decomposition process involves separating the desired speech signals from the background noise and other interfering sounds.

\section{Data Flow Design}
\par
The audio input undergoes pre-processing, while the visual input is processed to extract relevant cues. The pre-processed audio and processed visual data are then integrated. From the integrated representation, features are extracted. These features are utilized in the speech separation stage, where individual speech signals are separated from the mixture. Post-processing techniques are applied to enhance the quality of the separated speech signals. Finally, the individual speech signals are outputted as the result of the system. The data flow design ensures a sequential flow of operations, starting from capturing and processing the inputs, integrating the audio-visual information, extracting features, performing speech separation, applying post-processing, and generating the output. This design allows for effective processing and separation of audio visual data to obtain distinct speech signals from overlapping speakers.

\chapter{Implementation}


\section{Audio Extraction}
\par
Audio extraction is the process of isolating and extracting the audio content from a multimedia source, such as a video file. It involves separating the audio track from the accompanying video or other elements to obtain a standalone audio file representing the sound present in the source material.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in,height=3in]{./pic/sjeclogo.png}
\caption{code snippet for audio extraction}
\end{figure}

\section{Speech Separation}
\par SpeechBrain is an open-source framework 

\subsection{Sepformer}
\par SepFormer is an algorithm for speech separation that utilizes self-attention mechanisms. It employs a transformer-based architecture to capture long-range dependencies and model the relationships between time-frequency points in the audio mixture, enabling the separation of multiple speech sources from the mixture.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in,height=3in]{./pic/sjeclogo.png}
\caption{code snippet for speech separation}
\end{figure}

\section{Speech Enhancement}
\subsection{Lite Audio Visual Speech Enhancement}
\par
Lite AVSE algorithm is used for the separation and enhancement of the speech. The system 
includes two visual data compression techniques and removes the visual feature extraction 
network from the training model, yielding better online computation efficiency. As for the audio 
features, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is calculated of 3-second audio segments. Each 
time-frequency (TF) bin contains the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, both of 
which used as input. Power-law compression used to prevent loud audio from overwhelming soft 
audio. The same processing is applied to both the noisy signal and the clean reference signal.

\caption{code snippet for speech enhancement using LAVSE}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spectral Subtraction}
Spectral subtraction is a technique used in audio signal processing to reduce background noise from an audio signal. It involves estimating the noise spectrum from a noisy signal and subtracting it from the noisy spectrum to enhance the desired signal. The resulting spectrum is then transformed back into the time domain to obtain a cleaner audio signal as in Figure \ref{fig:pic3}

\section{Speaker Detection}
\par The cv2 functions provide methods to load the pre-trained models, apply them to images or video frames, and draw bounding boxes around the detected faces. By leveraging cv2's face detection capabilities, you can automate tasks such as facial recognition, emotion analysis, or face tracking in various applications like surveillance, biometrics, or augmented reality.

\chapter{System Testing}
\par
Testing is a procedure of executing the program with unequivocal intension of \cite{ref4}
discovering mistakes, assuming any, which makes the program, fall flat. This stage is an
essential piece of improvement.
\par
It plays out an exceptionally basic part for quality affirmation and for guaranteeing
unwavering quality of programming. It is the way toward finding the mistakes and
missing operation and furthermore an entire confirmation to decide if the targets are met
the client prerequisites are fulfilled.
\par
The objective of testing is to reveal prerequisites, outline or coding blunders in the
projects. Therefore, unique levels of testing are utilized in programming frameworks. The
testing results are utilized amid upkeep. The testcases are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pic4}

\section{Testing Objectives}
This area manages the points of interest in the various classes of the test which should be
directed to approve capacities, imperatives and execution. This can be accomplished
fundamentally by using the methods for testing, which assumes a crucial part in the
improvement of a product.

\section{Types of Testing conducted}
The structure of the program is not being considered in useful testing. Test cases are
exclusively chosen on the premise of the prerequisites or particulars of a program or
module of program but the internals of the module or the program are not considered for
determination of experiments\cite{ref1}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in,height=1in]{pic/sjeclogo.png}
\caption{testcases}
\label{fig:pic4}
\end{figure}
The program to be tried is executed with an arrangement of experiments and the yield of
the program for the experiments is assessed to decide whether the program is executing
not surprisingly. The accomplishment of testing in uncovering mistakes in projects
depends basically on the experiments. There are two fundamental ways to deal with
testing Black Box or functional Testing and White Box or structural testing. Table \ref{tab:t1} shows the workflow.
