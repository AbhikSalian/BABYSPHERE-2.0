\chapter{Problem Statement}

\section{Description}
Caregivers of infants face considerable stress and anxiety around the safety and health of their babies, especially during sleep. Traditional baby monitors lack advanced health-tracking capabilities and are primarily audio-based, which provides limited information on the baby's well-being. The absence of comprehensive health monitoring often leaves caregivers unaware of potential health risks, such as fever, unusual heart rates, or dangerous sleeping postures that can increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other breathing-related complications. Consequently, caregivers are forced to manually check on their babies frequently, disrupting their sleep and daily lives.

\section{Context}
This problem has a significant impact on caregiver peace of mind and child health. In recent years, research has highlighted the importance of tracking key infant health metrics in real time to ensure safety, particularly during sleep. Sudden health issues, such as breathing irregularities or heart rate changes, are particularly concerning in newborns. Additionally, sleep disruptions in infants can affect overall development, making continuous health monitoring critical. However, current baby monitoring solutions lack the non-invasive, comprehensive, and accessible technology necessary for accurate, real-time tracking of multiple health parameters. Our project seeks to address this gap by creating an advanced monitoring system that provides caregivers with reliable, real-time alerts, minimizing anxiety and supporting better infant care.

\chapter{Research and Empathy}
\section{User Insights}
To develop a baby monitoring system that truly meets caregivers' needs, we conducted extensive user research, including interviews, surveys, and observational studies with parents and caregivers. Key findings revealed that parents’ primary concerns included the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), changes in body temperature, irregular breathing, and unsafe sleeping positions. These concerns lead many parents to experience constant anxiety, particularly during nighttime or when they are away from the baby. Survey responses indicated that 82\% of caregivers check on their baby at least once every 2 hours due to these worries. A notable quote from one of the participants encapsulated this sentiment: "I never feel fully at ease unless I can see and know my baby is okay."

Through analyzing these insights, we identified three core needs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Real-time Monitoring:} Parents wanted the ability to monitor key health metrics like temperature, heart rate, and sleep posture in real-time.
  \item \textbf{Instant Alerts:} Caregivers expressed a need for instant alerts in case of any abnormality, especially in situations where their baby might be at risk.
  \item \textbf{Remote Access:} Many parents requested the ability to check on their baby’s status even when they are not in the same room, or when they are at work or on errands.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Empathy Map}
To deepen our understanding, we created an empathy map representing caregivers' emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and pain points. This map helped us to visualize and prioritize user needs for the project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Says:} ``I just need to know that my baby is safe, especially when they’re sleeping.” Caregivers repeatedly expressed their desire for a solution that provides them with peace of mind.

 \item \textbf{Thinks:} ``Is my baby sleeping safely? What if I miss something important?" Many caregivers reported a constant mental burden, worrying about their child’s safety, which often impacts their own rest and productivity.
  
  \item \textbf{Feels:} Caregivers consistently described feeling anxious, fearful, and stressed, particularly at night or during naps. They noted that while traditional baby monitors provide some reassurance, they lack comprehensive health tracking and alerting capabilities.
  
  \item \textbf{Does:} Many caregivers frequently check on their baby physically, even if it interrupts their own sleep. The absence of a reliable monitoring solution leads them to take extra precautions, such as adjusting the baby's position multiple times during sleep, keeping bedroom doors open, and using outdated baby monitors for audio or video surveillance.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Empathy Map Visual Representation}
The empathy map visually represents user emotions and pain points, providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the caregivers’ perspectives. We identified that caregivers' feelings of anxiety were strongly tied to a lack of reliable monitoring solutions, leading them to crave a system that offers reassurance through continuous health data and timely alerts.

This research and empathy-driven approach have shaped our project’s features to ensure a user-centered design that genuinely addresses caregiver concerns. The insights gained will be foundational in our development process, guiding every aspect of our solution from functionality to user interface design. By incorporating real user needs, we are more likely to develop a solution that resonates with and is beneficial to our target audience.

\chapter{Definition}
\section{Point of View (POV)}
Our primary user is a caregiver who experiences anxiety over their baby's safety, especially during sleep. This user needs a reliable way to monitor their baby’s health and safety remotely, without disturbing the baby or physically checking on them throughout the night. They seek reassurance through real-time data on critical health metrics and timely alerts in case of potential dangers, such as abnormal heart rate, body temperature fluctuations, or risky sleep positions that could lead to suffocation or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

\section{Problem Statement}
Caregivers lack an effective solution for monitoring key health metrics of their baby while being alerted in real-time about potential safety risks. Traditional monitoring devices provide limited information and often lack advanced safety alerts, resulting in heightened stress and interrupted sleep for caregivers. Therefore, we are developing a comprehensive monitoring system that combines real-time data tracking with automatic alerts to enable caregivers to monitor their baby’s well-being remotely, giving them the peace of mind they need.

\chapter{Ideation}
\section{Brainstorming Process}
Our ideation process began with brainstorming sessions among the project team, informed by user insights and empathy mapping. We used methods like mind mapping and the "How Might We" (HMW) technique to generate solutions that could meet caregivers' needs. We explored various ideas for tracking and alerting on vital signs, developing intuitive interfaces for ease of use, and integrating remote monitoring capabilities.

In these sessions, we outlined the major components required to meet our problem statement: sensors for capturing body metrics (like temperature and heart rate), a real-time alert system, remote connectivity to allow monitoring from anywhere, and an intuitive dashboard or mobile app interface for caregivers.

\section{Idea Highlights}
The final set of ideas prioritized caregiver needs, focusing on creating a monitoring solution with the following key features:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Non-Invasive Health Monitoring:} Using sensors for continuous tracking of vital metrics without disturbing the baby.
  \item \textbf{Real-Time Alerts:} An alert system to notify caregivers immediately in case of unusual health readings or unsafe sleeping positions.
  \item \textbf{Remote Access via Mobile App:} An easy-to-use mobile app that displays live data, health history, and customization options for alert settings.
  \item \textbf{User-Centered Interface Design:} Simple, intuitive interface allowing quick access to key information without overwhelming caregivers.
\end{enumerate}
These ideas were refined to form the foundation for our prototype, balancing the technical feasibility of each feature with the highest potential for solving caregivers’ core pain points.

\chapter{Prototyping}
\section{Prototype Overview}
Our initial prototype focuses on combining hardware components with a software interface. The hardware includes sensors capable of capturing data on body temperature, heart rate, and baby posture, which is critical for monitoring sleep safety. The mobile app interface allows caregivers to see real-time data on these metrics and customize alert thresholds according to their preferences. We also included a notification system that triggers instant alerts if any health parameter goes outside safe ranges.

We designed the prototype with scalability in mind, ensuring future additions (like more health metrics or connectivity options) could be easily integrated. The prototype is aimed at being user-friendly and accessible, while providing the essential functionalities required for effective baby monitoring.
