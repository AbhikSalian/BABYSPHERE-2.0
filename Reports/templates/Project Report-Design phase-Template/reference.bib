abstract = {Marginalized communities like deaf-blind people are excluded from several forms of communication. This paper introduces a novel system of interaction to support deafblind people's communication and therefore enhance their independence. We introduce the Mobile Lorm Glove: a mobile communication and translation device for the deafblind. The glove translates the hand-touch alphabet Lorm, a common form of communication used by people with both hearing and sight impairment, into text and vice versa. We will present a hardware prototype, created in a participatory design process, which enables the deaf-blind user to compose messages via fabric pressure sensors placed on the palm of the glove to be transmitted as an SMS to the receiver's handheld. Initiated by small vibrating motors located on the back of the glove, tactile feedback patterns allow the wearer to perceive incoming messages. We discuss related work, prototype design and interaction design and application scenarios. We conclude with an outlook into further research.},

abstract = {Deafblindness, also known as dual sensory loss, is the combination of sight and hearing impairments of such extent that it becomes difficult for one sense to compensate for the other. Communication issues are a key concern for the Deafblind community. We present the design and technical implementation of the Tactile Board: a mobile Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device for individuals with deafblindness. The Tactile Board allows text and speech to be translated into vibrotactile signs that are displayed real-time to the user via a haptic wearable. Our aim is to facilitate communication for the deafblind community, creating opportunities for these individuals to initiate and engage in social interactions with other people without the direct need of an intervener.},
