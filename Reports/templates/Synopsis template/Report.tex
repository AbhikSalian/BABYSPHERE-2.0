\section*{Project Title}
The title must be written after drafting the whole project proposal; It has been written so that it is a true representative of the project plan. 
Example: An Application for Medicinal Plant Identification using Computer Vision

\section*{Type of Project}
Research project / Product based project (Hardware) / Application project (Software) / Research \& Application based project (Choose one which is most suitable to your project work)

\section*{Background for the  the project}
Should contain a brief background of the selected topic. It must identify the importance of study, It must clearly state the purpose of the study. 

Example: In today’s advanced world of medicine, exploring and understanding medicinal plants is like discovering a treasure chest where ancient wisdom meets modern health needs. For  centuries, people have relied on specific plants to heal and improve well-being. Now,  amidst complex medicines and growing environmental concerns, understanding these  plants holds great importance.  Diverse cultures have passed down knowledge about  these plants through generations, a precious legacy. This traditional wisdom provides a  natural approach to health, fostering a deep connection with nature. In response to the increasing demand for herbal medicines, we develop an application to automatically identify the plants based on its images. 

\section*{Objectives }
The aim/goal should be explained here.

Example: The aim  of the proposed project wrok are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To create a our own medicinal plant dataset
    \item To develop a deep learning algorithm with high accuracy to identify the plant
    \item To develop a web and mobile application to automatically identify the medicinal plant based on its image
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Software / Hardware Requirements}
List the Software/Hardware required for the development of the project. 

Example: 
The software requirements are: Python IDE, Tensorflow, Keras, Android studio, Wamp web server. 

Hardware requirements are: GPU to perform training.
