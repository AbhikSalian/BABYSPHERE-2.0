\section*{Project Title}
BABYSPHERE 2.0: A cloud-based smart monitoring device for your loved one

\section*{Type of Project}
Product based project (Software along with Hardware)

\section*{Background for the  the project}
In recent years, the rise in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
 and other health concerns related to newborns has highlighted 
 the need for continuous and accurate monitoring of babies. 
 Many parents face the challenge of balancing their busy 
 schedules while ensuring their child’s safety, especially when 
 they are not physically present. Traditional monitoring devices
  often lack intelligent features that can detect critical signs,
   such as body temperature or unsafe sleeping positions. With 
   advancements in cloud technology and computer vision, there 
   is an opportunity to develop smart monitoring systems that 
   provide real-time alerts and actionable insights. The 
   `BABYSPHERE 2.0' project aims to address these issues by 
   creating a cloud-based system capable of monitoring baby 
   body temperature, room conditions, and movements using 
   computer vision, helping parents prevent potential dangers 
   like SIDS through timely alerts.

\section*{Objectives }
The objectives of the proposed project work are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a cloud-based monitoring platform that collects and manages baby and room temperature data.
    \item To provide real-time alerts to parents regarding abnormal temperature readings.
    \item To integrate computer vision technology to detect unsafe sleeping positions and notify parents.
    \item To create a user-friendly interface that allows parents to easily monitor and receive notifications.
    \item To deliver actionable notifications through SMS, email, or app alerts in a timely manner.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Software / Hardware Requirements}
List the Software/Hardware required for the development of the project. 

Example: 
The software requirements are: Python IDE, Tensorflow, Keras, Android studio, Wamp web server. 

Hardware requirements are: GPU to perform training.
