# BABYSPHERE-2.0

Work in progress...

## To collaborators:
- Create a new branch before working on your part.
- Don't work on the main branch.
- Everyone working on main branch will create conflicts.
- Main branch will be used only for working on reports.
  ### While working on reports:
  - Better to work in VS Code itself rather than Overleaf.
  - Because we can sync our part easily using Git.
  - Install an extension in VS Code to Generate pdf side-by-side as we edit the latex file.
  - Refer this video on installation process: https://youtu.be/4lyHIQl4VM8?si=N74UEEY8uBVDs7Fc
